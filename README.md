## Overview

The **Symptom Checker** is an intelligent application designed to assist users in identifying potential health conditions based on their reported symptoms. Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this tool analyzes user input and matches it against a comprehensive dataset of symptoms and associated conditions. The goal is to provide users with informative responses and guidance on when to seek medical attention.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for easy interaction.
- **NLP Integration**: Leverages NLP algorithms to understand and process user input effectively.
- **Extensive Symptom Dataset**: Contains a wide range of symptoms and their corresponding conditions, ensuring accurate matching.
- **Response Generation**: Provides informative responses based on user symptoms, including advice on when to consult a healthcare professional.
- **Continuous Learning**: The dataset can be expanded and updated to include new symptoms and conditions as they emerge.

## Dataset

The application uses a JSON dataset (`symptoms.json`) that includes:

- **Tags**: Unique identifiers for each health condition.
- **Patterns**: Common phrases and symptoms that users might report.
- **Responses**: Informative messages that guide users based on their reported symptoms.

### Example Entry

```json
{
  "tag": "migraine",
  "patterns": [
    "I have a severe headache",
    "My head hurts a lot",
    "I feel nauseous with my headache"
  ],
  "responses": [
    "These symptoms may indicate a migraine. Consider resting in a dark room and staying hydrated.",
    "If headaches persist or worsen, consult a healthcare provider for further evaluation."
  ]
}
```
